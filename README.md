# RegexStash README

A VS Code extension to stash all your data cleaning regexes.

## Features

This extension allows you to manage and run multiple regexes at the same time.

The default VS Code Find/Replace mechanisms only holds one find/replace pair at a time.

If you're repeatedly running the same series of regexes on a file, this extension will keep track of them and gives you greater flexibility during usage.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.
